The Land Registry Smart Contract is a decentralized blockchain-based solution that allows users to register land parcels and transfer ownership securely. This project utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to provide an immutable and transparent land ownership record, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The contract enables landowners to register land with unique identifiers, location details, and area specifications. It also allows ownership transfers between parties while maintaining a public and verifiable history of transactions. 
Key Features:
1. Secure Registration: Ensures that each land parcel is uniquely registered.
2. Ownership Verification: Users can verify ownership details at any time.
3. Decentralized Storage: Eliminates the risk of tampering or unauthorized modifications.
4. Seamless Ownership Transfer: Allows the current owner to transfer land ownership securely.
5. Transparency & Trust: Maintains a tamper-proof history of land transactions.
